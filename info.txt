to extract all landmarks:
    try:
        landmarks = results.pose_landmarks.landmark
        print(landmarks)
^^the print will show us the cordinate of each landmark on our body and their connections

to find the index position of the landmarks:
    print(mpPOSE.PoseLandmark.<name_of_landmark>.value)
^^this will print the landmark index position

to extract a particular landmark:
    landmarks[mpPOSE.PoseLandmark.<name_of_landmark>]
    example: landmarks[mpPOSE.PoseLandmark.LEFT_SHOULDER]

^^this will give the cordinates of the landmark
    to check a particular cordinate:
    landmarks[mpPOSE.PoseLandmark.<name_of_landmark>.value].x/y/z


------------------Speech recognition: future implementation------------------------
The primary purpose of a Recognizer instance is, of course, to recognize speech.
Each instance comes with a variety of settings and functionality for recognizing speech from an audio source.

Recognizer class require an audio_data argument.In each case, audio_data must be an instance of SpeechRecognitionâ€™s AudioData class.
Noise is a fact of life. All audio recordings have some degree of noise in them,
and un-handled noise can wreck the accuracy of speech recognition apps.
