to extract all landmarks:
    try:
        landmarks = results.pose_landmarks.landmark
        print(landmarks)
^^the print will show us the cordinate of each landmark on our body and their connections

to find the index position of the landmarks:
    print(mpPOSE.PoseLandmark.<name_of_landmark>.value)
^^this will print the landmark index position

to extract a particular landmark:
    landmarks[mpPOSE.PoseLandmark.<name_of_landmark>]
    example: landmarks[mpPOSE.PoseLandmark.LEFT_SHOULDER]

^^this will give the cordinates of the landmark
    to check a particular cordinate:
    landmarks[mpPOSE.PoseLandmark.<name_of_landmark>.value].x/y/z
